 Gulp and Angular Boilerplate
=============================

This is an extension based on the great tutorial: [Kickstarting angular with gulp](http://mherman.org/blog/2014/08/14/kickstarting-angular-with-gulp/#.VZrbZ3WlxBd).

It has an extra: all the gulp files are stored individually in the gulp-tasks directory.
